### Problem definition

Types of answers that ML gives are:

- classifying
- detect anamolies
- getting values; how many or how much?
- what are the different categories?
- what should I do next?

### Data Sourcing

Ideas for sources: RESTful, SOAP, files, SQL, proprietary sensors

### Data Preparation

missing data; unnecesary attributes; detect outliers

### Data Segregation

training set, validation set

### Model Training

adjust algorithms; usually on-shelf recipes; choice from several algorithms

### Model Evaluation

check with validation set

### Model Deployment

make model useful for business

### Model Monitoring
